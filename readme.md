# idunno.Security.Ssrf

A .NET 8, 9 and 10 library to help mitigate Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities in .NET applications that use `HttpClient` or `ClientWebSocket`.

## Getting Started

Add the `idunno.Security.Ssrf` package to your project, and then when you create an `HttpClient` and add an instance of the handler
to the message handler pipeline.

```c#
using (var httpClient = new HttpClient(idunno.Security.SsrfSocketsHttpHanderFactory.Create()))   
{
    _ = await httpClient.GetAsync(new Uri("bad.ssl.fail")).ConfigureAwait(false);
}
```

If you want to protect a `ClientWebSocket` you can pass a an instance of the handler in as the invoker parameter of
`ConnectAsync(Uri uri, System.Net.Http.HttpMessageInvoker? invoker, System.Threading.CancellationToken cancellationToken);`.

```c#

using (var webSocket = new ClientWebSock())
using (var httpClient = new HttpClient(idunno.Security.SsrfSocketsHttpHanderFactory.Create()))
{
    await _client.ConnectAsync(
        uri: "wss://echo.websocket.org",
        invoker: httpClient);
}
```

If the SSRF handler finds an unsafe host, or a host that resolves to an IP unsafe address it will throw an `SsrfException`.

If the SSTF handler finds an unsafe protocol, (i.e. http://, ws://) it will throw an `SsrfException`, unless
the `allowInsecureProtocols` parameter is set to `true` when calling `SsrfSocketsHttpHanderFactory.Create()`. It will always throw
when it encounters an non-HTTP/HTTPS/WS/WSS protocol, even if `allowInsecureProtocols` is set to `true`.

If the SSRF handler finds a mixture of safe and unsafe IP addresses for a host it will throw an `SsrfException` unless the
`failMixedResults` parameter is set to `false` when calling `SsrfSocketsHttpHanderFactory.Create()`.
If `failMixedResults` is set to `false` then the handler will allow the request to proceed to any safe IP addresses, and will ignore any unsafe IP addresses.
This is not recommended, as it could allow an attacker to bypass the SSRF protection by poisoning DNS results to include both safe and unsafe
IP addresses, but it is provided as an option for scenarios where a host may legitimately resolve to both safe and unsafe IP addresses.

Depending on where the exception it thrown, and the type of client it will end up as the `InnerException` on the
`HttpRequestException`, `SocketException` or `WebSocketException` thrown by the client.

## Manual URI and IP checking Helper Methods

If you want to manually check URIs supplied by untrusted you can use the `idunno.Security.Ssrf` class.

```c#

if (idunno.Security.Ssrf.IsUnsafeUri(new Uri("https://bad.ssl.fail")))
{
    // Disallow entry of this URI into the system, or log an alert, or whatever you want to do with it.
}
```

If you want to manually check an IP address you can use the `idunno.Security.Ssrf` class.
```c#

if (idunno.Security.Ssrf.IsUnsafeIpAddress(IPAddress.Parse("127.0.0.1")))
{
    // Disallow this IP address from being used in the system, or log an alert, or whatever you want to do with it.
}
```

If you want to perform both checks you can use the `IsUnsafe` method, which will check both the URI and the resolved IP addresses.

Note these checks are performed within `SsrfSocketsHttpHanderFactory.Create()` during the creation of an outgoing connection,
so you don't need to call them yourself if you're using the handler.

**DO NOT** solely rely on the `IsUnsafeUri` method for validating URIs. This would create a TOCTOU vulnerability, as the URI could be modified after validation but before use.
Use the message handler for `HttpClient` and `ClientWebSocket` to ensure that resolved IP addresses are checked against the block list as an
outgoing request is made.

## Key Features

* Mitigates Common SSRF vulnerabilities in .NET applications that use `HttpClient` or `ClientWebSocket`.
* Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, including loopback, link-local, and private address ranges.
* Allows for extra IP ranges to be added to the default block list.

## Release History

The [releases page](https://github.com/blowdart/idunno.Security.Ssrf/releases) provides details of each release and what was added, changed or removed.
The [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) also contains this information, as well as information on upcoming releases.

## Release Verification

The project uses an Authenticode certificate to sign assemblies and to author sign the nupkg packages.
nuget validates the signatures during its publication process.

To validate these signatures use

```
dotnet nuget verify [<package-path(s)>]
```

The subject name of the signing certificate should be

```
Subject Name: CN=Barry Dorrans, O=Barry Dorrans, L=Bothell, S=Washington, C=US
```

In addition, GitHub artifacts are attested during build,
and are also signed with [minisign](https://github.com/jedisct1/minisign) with the following public key.

```
RWTsT4BHHChe/Rj/GBAuZHg3RaZFnfBDqaZ7KzLvr44a7mO6fLCxSAFc
```

To validate a file using an artifact signature from a [release](https://github.com/blowdart/idunno.Security.Ssrf/releases)
download the `.nupkg` from nuget and the appropriate `.minisig` from the release page, then use the following command,
replacing `<package-path>` with the file name you wish to verify.

```
minisign -Vm <package-path> -P RWTsT4BHHChe/Rj/GBAuZHg3RaZFnfBDqaZ7KzLvr44a7mO6fLCxSAFc
```

Please note that nightly builds are signed with [Trusted Signing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/trusted-signing),
the signing certificate chain will not match the signing chain of a release build. The subject name remains the same.
